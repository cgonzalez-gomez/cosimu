Description: Cosimu is a package that simulates fold change vectors (signatures) related by a connectivity parameter as input, each element of the vectors represents a gene or transcript log2 fold changes in expression levels. In order to simulate related signautres, we decomposed the signatures into three layers: modality, sub-modality and probability layers.
